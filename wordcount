Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.
Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products.
Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations.
Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies.
